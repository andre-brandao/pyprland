You may install more plugins by using 3rd party or custom Python packages.

Pyprland provides the following plugins:

- ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ [[scratchpads]] implements dropdowns & togglable poppups

- ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ [[workspaces_follow_focus]] provides commands and handlers allowing a more flexible workspaces usage on multi-monitor setups. If you think the multi-screen behavior of hyprland is not usable or broken/unexpected, this is probably for you.
- ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ [[magnify]] toggles zooming of viewport or sets a specific scaling factor

- ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ [[shift_monitors]] adds a self-configured "swapactiveworkspaces" command
- ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ [[monitors]] allows relative placement of monitors depending on the model
- ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ [[toggle_special]] move windows from/to special workspaces in a single command
