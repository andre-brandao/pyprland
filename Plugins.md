You may install more plugins by using 3rd party or custom Python packages.
Pyprland provides the following plugins out of the box:

- `scratchpads` implements dropdowns & togglable poppups

- `monitors` allows relative placement of monitors depending on the model
- `expose` easily switch between scratchpads and active workspace :

- `workspaces_follow_focus` provides commands and handlers allowing a more flexible workspaces usage on multi-monitor setups. If you think the multi-screen behavior of hyprland is not usable or broken/unexpected, this is probably for you.
- `lost_windows` brings lost floating windows to the current workspace
- `toggle_dpms` toggles the DPMS status of every plugged monitor
- `magnify` toggles zooming of viewport or sets a specific scaling factor

- `shift_monitors` adds a self-configured "swapactiveworkspaces" command
